# hotwire
Had an old Raspberry Pi 1a sitting around and wanted to known whether the garage door was left open and monitor the home while away but didn't wanted to pay for a stupid alarm system contract. As a result, I decided to hookup octocouplers to the old alarm system. There's no point in adding logic there. Just throw everything at a MQTT server and figure it out from there. I used HomeAssistant to finalize the logic part.
